# Vision Contract
Non-negotiables:
- Runs in the browser.
- External services are accessed only via adapters (API boundary).
- Core simulation is deterministic and replayable.

Out of scope until kernel is stable:
- Blockchain anchoring, IPFS, Chainlink integrations (adapters later).
- Multi-persona orchestration layers.
