# Observability and Inspect Expansion

Goals: extend `inspect`/telemetry to summarize budget caps, deferred effects, adapter latency, and produce an HTML report; add fixtures and tests for new telemetry fields.

Open items to refine before implementation:
- Requirements, tests, docs, architecture impacts.
