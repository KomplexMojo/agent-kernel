# Persona-Driven Action Pipeline

Goals: route actions from intent/plan through execution policy/personas into runtime `step`, record accepted actions in tick frames, and add fixtures/tests for action flow.

Open items to refine before implementation:
- Requirements, tests, docs, architecture impacts.
