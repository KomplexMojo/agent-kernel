# Architecture Charter (Ports & Adapters)

`packages/core-ts` is the deterministic core. It must not depend on UI, network, storage, filesystem, clocks, process state, or Node APIs.

## Core vs Runtime

- **`core-ts`**: simulation state, transition rules, validation, render buffers, affinity field computation, motivation evaluation, and data-only effects.
- **Runtime personas**: long-lived controllers that coordinate planning, tick phases, action ordering, telemetry, and adapter interaction.
- **Adapters/UI**: host-specific IO and presentation. They call runtime or consume artifacts; they do not own simulation rules.

## Dependency Direction

```text
adapters-* -> runtime -> core-ts
ui-web     -> runtime -> core-ts
```

All external IO must be implemented behind adapters via narrow ports. Core APIs remain synchronous and deterministic.

## Core Responsibilities

- Canonical simulation state and legal state transitions.
- Pure validation and deterministic rule enforcement.
- Data-only effects with deterministic ids/requestIds and adapter hints.
- Affinity system: 10-kind codebook, spatial formulas, interaction matrix, static trap and actor field computation.
- Motivation system: 12-kind codebook, cost formulas, behavior flags, and profile derivation.
- Render buffers and observations derived from canonical state.

## Runtime Responsibilities

- Tick FSM and persona orchestration.
- Action proposal, ordering, replay, and telemetry capture.
- Artifact normalization and schema boundary enforcement.
- Solver/external fact request routing through ports.
- UI-facing visualization assembly from core outputs and resource bundles.

## Builder Port

Heavy level synthesis runs behind a builder adapter. UI code hands off summaries, normalized `levelGen`, or direct tile rows to that adapter instead of synthesizing layouts on the main thread.

## Combat Boundary

- `packages/core-ts/src/rules/combat.ts` owns the deterministic combat primitive: `createCombatRules(world).applyAttack(attackerIndex, defenderIndex, damage)`.
- `core.applyAttack` is the only mutation entry point for HP changes caused by an attack. It enforces valid actor indices, rejects self-attacks, requires Chebyshev-1 adjacency, requires positive integer damage, and clamps defender HP to `0`.
- Runtime never mutates HP directly for attacks. `packages/runtime/src/runner/runtime-fsm.mjs` adapts actor `attack` actions into a direct `{ kind: "apply_attack" }` directive, converts runtime actor IDs to core motivated-actor indices, and calls `core.applyAttack`.
- `core-ts` remains IO-free and runtime-ignorant: no adapter imports, no clocks, no process state, and no dependency on persona or runtime action shapes.

## Motivation And Action Flow

- Simple actor motivations are resolved deterministically in `packages/runtime/src/personas/actor/controller.js`.
- `buildMotivatedProposals()` reads `motivation.kind` from the observation actor record or `payload.initialState.actors`. It uses `resolveNearestHostile()` to choose the closest other actor by Chebyshev distance.
- Current simple motivation kinds are `attacking`, `defending`, and `stationary`: attacking actors attack adjacent hostiles or pursue distant hostiles, defending actors attack adjacent hostiles or hold position when distant, and stationary actors emit no movement proposal.
- Complex motivation is opt-in. Actors with runtime decisioning enabled, for example `runtimeDecisioning: { enabled: true, mode: "solver", preferred: "solver", targetAdapter: "z3" }`, emit a `solver_request` effect instead of directly returning a concrete action.

## Solver Adapter Boundary

- Complex motivation must route through the runtime solver port (`packages/runtime/src/ports/solver.js`) and adapter implementations. Runtime code constructs the request envelope and consumes the normalized result; it does not embed solver-specific logic.
- `packages/runtime/src/personas/_shared/runtime-decision.mts` resolves fulfilled solver results through `resolveActionFromSolverResult()` and maps the selected candidate back to a concrete runtime action.
- The Z3-shaped adapter currently lives in `packages/adapters-test/src/adapters/solver/z3-adapter.js`. It is a deterministic priority-rule adapter for tests, not a real Z3 binding.
- Z3 adapter code must not move into `runtime` or `core-ts`. The dependency direction remains `adapters-* / ui-web -> runtime -> core-ts`.

## UI Sandbox Playback

- The M1 sandbox contract is playback over precomputed `tickFrames`, not live tick execution from Step or Run-To-End controls.
- `packages/ui-web/src/scenario-loader.js` compiles a scenario into a gameplay bundle by running the runtime to completion once, then the UI replays the recorded frames.
- `globalThis.__ak_loadScenario(scenario, options)` compiles and forwards to `globalThis.__ak_loadGameplayBundle(bundle, options)`.
- `packages/ui-web/src/views/gameplay-view.js` implements Step and `runToEnd()` by moving the current frame cursor over `tickFrames`; it does not call runtime step during playback.
